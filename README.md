# LT-Spice---Analysis-of-different-load-conditions-for-an-AC-circuit
The main objective of the LTSpice simulation was to analyze voltage and current behavior under varying load conditions while validating simulated values against analytically derived ones. This study demonstrates fundamental transmission line and impedance matching concepts using AC signal excitation
